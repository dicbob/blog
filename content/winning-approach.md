I came out of the shower today with a text from my boss saying "Semi-Urgent".  Oh?  What could this be, I ask myself with urgency?  Turns out I had chance to have lunch at Morton's in San Francisco. It gets better...This was a vendor luncheon, with [Bruce Bochy][]. Manager of the World Champion San Francisco [Giants][].  The Giant's manager of the team's first and second championship wins.  Awesome.

Myself being an avid baseball fan and lifelong St. Louis [Cardinals][] die-hard. Its easy to be a Giants fan too.  I saw Barry Bonds smash some long home runs in old Busch Stadium, and was happy that it was SF where the great Willie McGee left the Birds for. Not to mention the playoff battles the Cards and Giants have waged (1985 & 2012). When the Giants beat my beloved Red Birds out for a trip to the World Series last year, I cheered Giants all the way. Sure, it took me months to shake off Barry Zito's game 5 NLCS performance in StL.  If you don't remember.  Take my word for it, that is how pitching is done.

As you can tell I love baseball and for forty minutes today. I was in baseball heaven!  Sadly, not Busch Stadium in St. Louis, but face-to-face with Giants skipper Bruce Bochy.  Very nice fellow, as most ball players are.  He spoke to a group of 15 over lunch about managing a baseball team.  It seemed off the cuff, packed with great stories about his time in San Diego, his switch to the Giants, and winning the World Series.  I was surprised by two things.  His candor and humbleness.  Bruce's laugh while telling his stories, told me everything needed to know about the man.   

When Bruce took the contract in SF from the San Diego Padres. He described the experience "kind of weird".  One day your trying to beat them, next day your trying to make them win.  Bochy expressed concern for the personnel he was inheriting at the time, but he had confidence in the organizational "vision".  Many of us can relate to that very thing.  Change, whether it be new job or new management, can be jarring on both sides.  Making a team work within those constraints has to be a challenge.  

Bruce went on to talk about "The Misfits".  He acknowledged the fan given name for the team that won the series in 2010 was spot on. He described how it came together.  The Giants, like much of baseball, is multicultural.  Within groups of people, diverse or otherwise, the tension of the job can stack up (think 81 road games and playoffs).  With the challenges of diversity and stress, certain problems can arise.  From exhausted players, to extreme personality differences.  These problems are not solved purely by choosing the most talented, skilled, and in-shape players. Rather, there are more components to the success on top of skill and talent. As Bruce put it, the "Humble Swagger" and getting to know people.  Knowing the people, is about playing to strengths, and understanding motivations.  Bruce gave an example of a well known, talented pitcher in San Diego. That was purely motivated by a radar gun measuring his pitches. Bruce hacked the radar gun so it would register a lower speed.  He did this to motivate and humble said pitcher.  Because, the pitcher is there to get outs.  The radar gun can lie, and the Umpire always deals with certainty.

The other component to picking the right people is the "Humble Swagger".  Bruce said talent aside, he looks for self motivated, confident risk takers.  He looks for players that are proud of the number on their backs.  But know its the front of the jersey they play for. In the context of a playoff run to the World Series. The example was 2 superstar pitchers being benched. Players being asked to play positions and roles they had never before.  No one fought, no one had problems, and no one was standing in the office asking for answers.  Just 25 guys playing together to win!  Also part of the swagger, the confidence to critique and be critiqued.  We should *all* be helping each other be our best and stay on top.

Bruce also spoke briefly about motivating men with $100 million dollar contracts. In baseball everyone has similar goals.  Everyone wants a World Series ring, and everyone wants to keep playing.  Every individual on the team is different too. So finding a common goal to unite under, can prove difficult. Bochy was quick to point out the Giants have an opportunity to win another World Series this year.  Three championship wins in 5 years is a dynasty in baseball.  Ensuring a baseball legacy for the team and its players.  That is the motivation the team rides on now. 

Awesome day for this baseball fan.  It was great hearing first hand from the leader of a great team.  It was also easy to see why players and fans alike love Bruce Bochy.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to ask him any questions.  I did however get my picture taken with the skipper.  Of course, on behalf of us at Mozilla, I gave him 2 Firefox OS T-Shirts.
