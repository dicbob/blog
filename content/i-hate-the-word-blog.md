I have finally decided to jump into the world of blogging. As long as no one says the word "Blogosphere", I will 
do just fine.  I have always wanted to write and share with world my thoughts and work.  Maybe even a playlist or two.
My reasons for wait so long are vaild, but excuses at this point.  So here I go.

At the suggestion of my collegue and friend [mburns][] . I decide to use  [Pelican][] as a blog platform.  
Thus far Pelican is very nice.Easy to deploy and manage.  As a blogging platform it conforms to many of the tools I already use as sysadmin. Pelican generates static pages, which is perfect for me and the style blog I intend. WIth numerous publishing options the Makefile style is very simple to use.  You can read in my subsequest post all about my process.

I also decided to install a tinyurl system for my domain.  [Yourls][] is an awesome addition. Also fairly easy to 
deploy and manage. My own tinyurl system has worked out awesome so far.  I realized that how I bookmark, fire-and-forget, works. But when sharing something from last month, I have found it so much easier to search my tinyurl database for the link. I already have an easy shareable link ready.  Its even personalized for you:D

Easy first blog post. Thanks for stopping by.
