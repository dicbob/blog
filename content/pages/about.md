Rick Bryce here, I am a System Adminitrator working and living in the San Francisco Bay area.  Currently working for theawesome organization, [Mozilla][].  Along with my team, I help ensure Mozilla's vast server operations stay working when
you need to down load [Firefox][]. I think it goes with out saying, we stay pretty busy supporting Mozilla infrastructure.  But we get a chance to contribute as well.  I hope to share some our here and my expeirences here on my blog.

Aside from Linux and being a sysadmin I have a number of other hobbies and joys.  I once made a telescope by hand, and
am aming to build another if for no other reason to get out and enjoy California away from the cities.  If you have any expeience doing this email me.

Baseball, baseball, baseball.  Yes, that is correct. Big geek and big baseball fan.  My heart lies with the St. Louis
Cardinals. Living in the bay, I find myself a Giants fan too.  Nothing better than a friday night at the ballpark.  Coldbeers, hot dogs, and double-plays. 

I love bacon. I love to travel, who doesn't? 
I love lamp ;)
